My [master thesis] focused on **smart cards**.  
I studied ISO 14443, NFC, and EMV standards, and performed experiments with RTL-SDR devices to analyze their communication protocols.  
During my internship, I also carried out a smart card security assessment for one of the company’s clients.  
This work led to a one-year research contract with the [SPRITZ] group, resulting in a published paper on **blocking cards**.

My [bachelor thesis] focused on **video streaming**.  
I evaluated the performance of adaptive streaming algorithms (DASH) based on Quality of Experience under different network conditions.  
This research led to a publication in an IEEE journal titled:  
[Comparing DASH Adaptation Algorithms in a Real Network Environment].

My [master-thesis] was focused on smart cards. I studied ISO 14443, NFC and EMV standards and performed experiments with RTL-SDR devices to understand their communicaiton logic. Moreover, I also performed a smartcard security assesment for the client's of a company in which I had the internship. This work resulted in a year of contract with ([SPRITZ]) group which ended up with a research published on blocking cards.

My [bachelor-thesis] was focused on video streaming. I have evaluated video streaming algorithms performances based on quality of experience in different network conditions using a DASH player.
Starting from my thesis work, an article was published on the IEEE journal by the name: [Comparing DASH Adaptation Algorithms in a Real Network Environment].

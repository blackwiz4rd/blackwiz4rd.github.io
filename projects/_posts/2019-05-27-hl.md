The [Prisoner's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) is widely used to model social and economic interactions.  
In this project, we study its iterative version under several scenarios:

- Two-player interactions  
- A tournament involving N players  
- Multiple repetitions of the tournament with an increasing population  
- Adaptive strategies where players can change behavior between rounds  

The goal is to study the evolution of the population, analyze players' scores, and gain insight into the best strategies and potential winning players.

This project is the final assignment for the High-Level Programming course  
(also known as Laboratory of Computational Physics, module A), Fall 2018,  
Master's degree in ICT for Internet and Multimedia, University of Padova, Italy.

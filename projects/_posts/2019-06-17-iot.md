This project evaluates security issues in RFID devices and proposes a solution using a server and a 6LoWPAN architecture to validate tags.

The [server](https://github.com/blackwiz4rd/tagServer-IoT) was developed in Django (Python), and the [client](https://github.com/blackwiz4rd/tagClient-IoT) in Android.

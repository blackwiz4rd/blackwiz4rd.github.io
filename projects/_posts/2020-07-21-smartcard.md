Contactless smart cards are widely used in everyday life for a variety of applications,  
including tap-and-go payment cards, building access control, parking tickets, toll highways, ski passes, and public transport systems.  

Many modern smartphones also embed NFC chips, allowing card emulation.  
As a result, smartphones can provide similar functionality to smart cards while offering enhanced high-level security features.  

Nevertheless, some smart card systems, including certain payment systems, remain vulnerable to attacks.  
End-users must therefore take care to protect the privacy and security of their contactless smart cards, even when carrying them in pockets or bags.

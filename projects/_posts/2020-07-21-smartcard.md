Contactless smart cards are commonly used in every day life for a wide variety of ap-
plications ranging from tap-and-go payment cards, access control for buildings, parking tickets and toll highways as well as ski-passes and public transport systems. Moreover, most of the phones marketed nowadays embed NFC chips allowing card emulation. Thus, smartphones have turned out to provide the same functionality as smart cards, proving enhanced high-level security features. Nevertheless, some smart cards systems, including payment systems, are vulnerable to attacks. As a result, end-users must carefully protect their cards privacy when keeping contactless smart cards in their pockets.

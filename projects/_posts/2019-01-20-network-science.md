Map-based social networks are expected to become increasingly popular in the future.
This project analyzes a hypothetical network of users and their interactions.

The project is divided into two parts:

- [Part 1 – Network Analysis](https://github.com/blackwiz4rd/NetworkScience/blob/master/hw1/NetworkScience9:10.pdf)
- [Part 2 – Extended Analysis](https://github.com/blackwiz4rd/NetworkScience/blob/master/hw2/NetworkScience10%2B:10.pdf)

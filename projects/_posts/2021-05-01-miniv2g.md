The global push to limit climate change has accelerated the development of renewable energy solutions.  
One emerging trend is the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs), which rely on electricity instead of fossil fuels and leverage the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) paradigm.  

V2G introduces novel challenges and potential security vulnerabilities.  
Attackers could exploit multiple surfaces, such as remote connections between the Distribution Grid and Charging Supply, or authentication systems between Charging Supply Equipment and EVs.  
However, the high cost and complexity of V2G architecture can limit research and practical experimentation in this field.

A DASH video player developed at the University of Padova was used to collect
runtime logs during both static and mobile network conditions.

The experimental analysis evaluates the behavior of adaptive streaming
algorithms under different network scenarios, such as WiFi and 3G mobility.

The thesis and the presentation (written in Italian) are available here:

- [Bachelor’s thesis (PDF)](/documents/bachelor-thesis.pdf)
- [Presentation slides](/documents/bachelor-keynote.pdf)

Additionally, a paper based on this work was published in an IEEE journal:

- [Comparing DASH Adaptation Algorithms in a Real Network Environment](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8835954)

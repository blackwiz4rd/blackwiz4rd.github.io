noindex: true
---
This project focuses on stereo disparity computation using image pairs acquired
from an Aquifi camera and a projected random dot pattern.

Disparity is computed using a multi-layer hierarchical approach, enabling robust
depth estimation under challenging visual conditions. The methodology,
implementation details, and experimental results are documented in the report.
